Keyboard Accessibility:
Our use of interactive elements (like buttons in modals) means that keyboard accessibility has been considered. We have even added keyboard feature to control our slides in edit as well as preview format. Esc used in preview to go back to the edit page. 

Form Accessibility:
We have used form controls and labels in your modals, every input field is properly labeled (<Form.Label> associated with <Form.Control> via htmlFor and id props) to improve screen reader accessibility.

Color Contrast and Visual Design:
Simple dark grey and white colour scheme has a high contrast and makes the website accessible for those with vision impairments. All buttons are also decently sized, and turn a different colour when hovered. 

Error Handling
We have implemented error handeling in various elements to check for our code and proper usage of the element by the user.

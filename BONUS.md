Things which are outside of the spec but we implemented to improve the UI/UX of our website:


Code LIVE preview:
When adding a block of code to the slide, you can see what the outputted block of code will look like live, complete with syntax highlighting. This helps users see if their code is correctly highlighted, and may help them visualise what it will look like on the slide. 

Nav bar:
Once we log in, we are taken to the dashboard. This dashboard has a navigation bar at the top to make it easy for users to navigate the website. On this navigation bar, we have a website logo and name, a new presentation button which lights up green when hovered, and a logout button which also lights up when hovered over. 

Favicon and tab name:
We used our logo for the favicon and changed the browser tab name to Presto to make it look more professional.

Hover over presentations:
When a presentation is hovered over in the dashboard, it becomes slightly enlarged so the user knows its clickable.

Preview button:
We have implemented a close preview button visible when mouse is hovered over the body.

Delete Presentation:
We have asked multiple prompts when there is only one slide left in the presentation and delete that presentation only after accepting.

Edit Title Functionlity:
Instead of a button we used the title element itself to click and edit over.

Delete Slide:
At the side bar delete slide feature deletes that particular slide which the user is on and asks with a prompt for every slide deletion to avoid mistakes by the user.

Smooth Slide Transition:
For slide transitioning we implemented a smoother transition for user satisfaction.

Finally we have made our website keeping in mind of the responsive design as our presentation list as well as nav bar will follow the feature that is implemented in a responsive way.
